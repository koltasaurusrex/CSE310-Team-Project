# Overview


Django-Flash-Cards is an educational application developed to help students study
more effectively and was created by Chris Soares, Christine Helfrich, Lauren Warren, Jacob
Bird and Kolton Heaps.

As the name describes, this project uses the Django framework to handle the back-end services
and allows for easy administration of users and card sets through the built-in admin panel.

To use Django-Flash-Cards you will need to [install Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/install/)
and then download the project as a zip and extract or run `git clone https://github.com/koltasaurusrex/Django-Flash-Cards.git` to clone the project to your current directory.
After downloading the project, you will need to be in the /Django-Flash-Cards/Django-Flashcards-Web-App folder
and run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server. A web address will be displayed
that you can then navigate to in your browser.
